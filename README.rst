===================
BaseX Client Driver
===================

A Python client driver for the BaseX_ XML database. **(Pre-Alpha! Not yet usable!)**

This driver communicates with a BaseX database running in `Server Mode`_ using
the native `BaseX Server Protocol`_ using a Pythonic API rather than the
default Java-flavored API of the `official python driver`_.

**Note** this software is not ready! (You can connect to a database, but there are
no session or query abstractions yet.) Maybe in a few weeks it will
be awesome, but in the meantime use the `official driver`_, which isn't pretty
but which works!
